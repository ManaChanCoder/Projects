      <h1>What is Guinea Pig</h1>
      <p>The guinea pig or domestic guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), also known as the cavy or domestic cavy (/ˈkeɪvi/), is
        a species of rodent belonging to the genus Cavia in the family Caviidae. Breeders tend to use the word cavy to
        describe the animal, while in scientific and laboratory contexts, it is far more commonly referred to by the
        common name guinea pig.[1] Despite their common name, guinea pigs are not native to Guinea, nor are they closely
        related biologically to pigs, and the origin of the name is still unclear. They originated in the Andes of South
        America. Studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggest they are domesticated animals that do not exist
        naturally in the wild, descendants of a closely related cavy species such as C. tschudii.[2][3] They were
        originally domesticated as livestock for a source of meat, and are still consumed in some parts of the world.
        <br><br>
        In Western society, the guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a pet since its introduction to Europe
        and North America by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature, friendly responsiveness to
        handling and feeding, and the relative ease of caring for them have continued to make guinea pigs a popular
        choice of household pet. Organizations devoted to the competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed
        worldwide. Many specialized breeds, with varying coat colors and textures, are selected by breeders.
        <br><br>
        Livestock breeds of the guinea pig play an important role in folk culture for many indigenous Andean peoples,
        especially as a food source.[4] The animals are also used in folk medicine and in community religious
        ceremonies.[5] They are raised for their meat and are a culinary staple in the Andes Mountains, where they are
        known as cuy. In the 1960s a modern breeding program was started in Peru that resulted in large breeds known as
        cuy mejorados (improved cuy). Marketers tried to increase consumption of the animal outside South America.[6]
        <br><br>
        Biological experimentation on domestic guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century. The animals were
        used so frequently as model organisms in the 19th and 20th centuries that the epithet guinea pig came into use
        to describe a human test subject. Since that time, they have been largely replaced by other rodents, such as
        mice and rats. However, they are still used in research, primarily as models to study such human medical
        conditions as juvenile diabetes, tuberculosis, scurvy (like humans, they require dietary intake of vitamin C),
        and pregnancy complications.</p>

            <p>The Silkie Guinea Pig breed is rather a novel Guinea pig variety, which was developed during the 1970s.
              It was created by cross breeding the Self Black Guinea Pig and the Peruvian Guinea Pig. Silkies are also
              commonly known as Shelties.</p>

            <h3>Peruvian</h3>
            <p>Peruvian guinea pigs are relatively easy to tell apart from other breeds. The middle parting and hair
              swirls (also called rosettes) on the hips and head are particularly striking. Another distinguishing
              feature is the resulting fringe, which gives these guinea pigs their cheeky appearance.</p>

              Unlike Himalayan guinea pigs, California points can be not only black or chocolate, but also purple and
              beige.</p>
